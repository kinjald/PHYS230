Don’t join the points by line segments; make each point a symbol such as a small circle or plus sign. Label the axes of your plot. Select some reasonable values for the parameter $\\tau$ in the model, and see if you can get a curve that fits the data well. Label the curves, then add a legend to identify which curve is which.<br>\n",

Find the slope and the y intercept of the straight line determined by the Equation in terms of the two unknown quantities $A$ and $\\tau$ . Next, estimate the slope and y intercept of the straight line determined by the data. From this, figure out some pretty good guesses for the values of A and $\\tau$ . Then, tweak the values to get a nicer looking fit.]\n",
